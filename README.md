# Crop Production and Temperature Analysis in Alberta, Canada

## Overview
This project aims to analyze the relationship between temperature and crop production in Alberta, Canada, utilizing data provided by the Canadian government and weather stations. With the looming impact of global warming on temperature patterns, the project further aims to predict future crop production trends based on this relationship.

## Data Sources
### Crop Data
The crop data utilized in this project is sourced directly from the Canadian government's Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada website. This dataset provides comprehensive information on Alberta's crop production over the last decade, offering valuable insights into agricultural trends and patterns. The direct link to the crop data for Alberta can be found [here](https://agriculture.canada.ca/en/market-information-system/rp/index%2Deng.cfm?action=ePR&R=243&PDCTC=#clfinput_err).

### Weather Data
Weather data, including temperature records, is obtained from ClimateData.ca, a platform that provides access to climate data from various weather stations across Canada. The weather data is crucial for understanding temperature fluctuations in Alberta over time. The weather station data can be downloaded from [here](https://climatedata.ca/download/#station-download).

## Project Objective
The primary objective of this project is to conduct data analysis and visualization to explore the relationship between temperature and crop production in Alberta, Canada. By leveraging historical data on temperature and crop yields, the project seeks to identify patterns and correlations that can be used to predict future crop production trends. Given the significance of Alberta as one of Canada's leading provinces in crop production, understanding how temperature changes impact crop yields in this region is of paramount importance.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Obtain historical data on crop production and temperature from the respective sources mentioned above.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Clean and preprocess the data to ensure consistency and reliability.
3. **Data Analysis**: Conduct thorough analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations between temperature and crop production.
4. **Data Visualization**: Visualize the relationship between temperature and crop production using charts, graphs, and maps.
5. **Predictive Modeling**: Develop predictive models to forecast future crop production based on projected temperature changes.

## Data Cleaning Process
The raw crop data obtained from the Canadian government's Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada website requires preprocessing before analysis. To streamline the analysis process, a file named `Crop_Data_Cleaning` has been developed. This script cleans up the source crop data report to a format that is easy to analyze. For convenience, this cleaning process is performed locally, and the cleaned file is stored in the `source data` folder within the project repository. The original file is in the folder as well with the name 'Report_G002_20240218_201419'

## Future Considerations
As global warming continues to alter temperature patterns, it is essential to regularly update the analysis and predictive models with new data. Additionally, exploring the impact of other climatic factors such as precipitation and extreme weather events on crop production could provide further insights into agricultural resilience and adaptation strategies.
